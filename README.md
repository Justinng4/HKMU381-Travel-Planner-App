## User Management API

This project provides a RESTful API for managing `User` resources using **Express.js** and **MongoDB**. It supports basic CRUD operations and uses **Mongoose** for database interactions.

---
## **Description**

This API allows you to:

1. **Get all users**: Fetch all users in the database.
2. **Get a specific user by ID**: Retrieve details of a specific user using their unique identifier.
3. **Create a new user**: Add a new user to the database with fields like `name`, `email`, and `password`.
4. **Update an existing user**: Modify specific fields of an existing user.
5. **Delete a user**: Remove a user from the database by their ID.

The API also includes middleware (`getUser`) to fetch and validate a user for PATCH and DELETE operations.

---

## **Features**

- **GET `/users`**: Fetch all users.
- **GET `/users/:id`**: Retrieve a user by their unique ID.
- **POST `/users`**: Create a new user with name, email, and password.
- **PATCH `/users/:id`**: Update specific fields of a user (e.g., name, email, or password).
- **DELETE `/users/:id`**: Delete a user by their ID.

## Operation guides
> Operation guides (like a user flow) for your server.
**'the use of Login logout pages'**

 User can go to the register site to make their own account,
 then will jump to the login page and then can login, and for the logout pages is the profile page, in there you can update you profile or you can logout the account.

1. Installation guideline

- the use of Login/Logout pages: a list of valid login information, sign in steps? â€¦
- the use of your CRUD web pages: which button or UI is used to implement create, read, update, and delete?
- the use your RESTful CRUD services: the lists of APIs? HTTP request types? Path URI? How to test them?
CURL testing commands?
Notes:
- `README.md` is important to let me know your project functions, which is crucial to marking the grade of
your project.
